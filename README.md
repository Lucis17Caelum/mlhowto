## About this
> Machine learnign is a hell of a hot topic and I have been working with it for a more than a year, in this process I had to learn A LOT in order to have a decent conversation with a Data Scientist, so I decided to share the steps I took to understand more about machine learning and even build my own models.

### What is Machine Learning

Google has a lot of content on ML, [this YouTube video gives a great summary](https://youtu.be/HcqpanDadyQ)

### Getting technical

The machine learning **Hello Wolrd**. The best way to understand exactly how it works is by actually developing it. Don't be scared, the Machine Learning Hello World is not that hard here are some steps:

First, let's get your dev enviroment up and running.

1. [Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | Python is a programming language.
2. [Download and install Anaconda] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) | Anaconda is a package manager for python, just like NPM
3. Install the machine learning toolkit for python, [SciKit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
4. Profit.

Now that you have your dev environment setup just follow [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&list=PLT6elRN3Aer7ncFlaCz8Zz-4B5cnsrOMt) by Google on coding your first ML model.
The tutorial is very simple and easy to follow, but if you just want to run the code and check its result [check out my examples](https://github.com/pmarquees/ml-playground). All of them were done while watching that Google video.
